# TENZO

Tenzo is a theme for Jekyll. It aims to be *effective*, *cheap*, *clean* and *simple*. You can see it in action [here](http://jnardiello.eu).

## Installation and styling

Clone or copy this folder and add your Markdown files to the `_posts` folder. Tenzo is designed to work out of the box. For an in-depth overview and more details please read [my launch post](http://jnardiello.eu/presenting-tenzo-for-jekyll.html).
